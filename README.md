# App Planning Lab

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Make sure when you read back your work that you've written things clearly, so that anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable add screenshots, photos, and links.

1. You will also deploy an `index.html` page to GitHub pages.

## Instructions

You will be planning a new application to develop that will be a competitor for another popular application. Your goal is to determine the minimal functionality required so you can launch your app as soon as possible.

Choose from any popular app. It can be an app for anything:


- Social media

## Questions

## Project Managing Tool

#### In 1-3 sentences describe your application.

> My app ...

#### What is the name of your application?

> SOCIAL: App

#### Create a minimum of 10 user stories. Make sure to use the format:

- `As a <new of user>, I want to <join>, so that <i can connect with my friends>.`
- `As a <user>, I want to <see what friends are online>, so that <message and contact them>.`
- `As a < user>, I want to <find events my friends are going to>, so that <i can plan to go with them>.`
- `As a  <user>, I want to <communicate with my friends>, so that <i can make plans and schedule events>.`
- `As a <event holder>, I want to <advertise my events>, so that <raise my attendance!>.`
- `As a < user>, I want to <block certain people>, so that <i am in control of my privacy>.`
- `As a < user>, I want to <be able to be discreet>, so that <i can use the site with being harrased by other people>.`
- `As a <event holder>, I want to <be able to charge online>, so that <make revnue from views>.`
- `As a <premium user>, I want to <view things without being harrased by sales>, so that <ihave an experince that's cost free>.`

#### Create a new board

Follow the format provided (name of board, the 5 lists etc.) in the reading.

- Add a minimum of 5 cards (front only) based on your user stories to `Backlog`.
- Add appropriate labels.

Provide a link to your board below.

> [XR-Lab](https://trello.com/b/ru3ALhVe/xr-lab)

#### For one card, fill out more details, include:

- The business case
- Acceptance criteria
- Notes
- Resources

Move that card to the `Doing` list and assign yourself to it.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [- `As a new user, I want to join , so that  i can connect with my friends.']()

#### Create one bug card.

Think back to a bug you had in a recent lab or project and do your best to model that example.
It can either be a bug you solved or that you didn't get a chance to solve.

It should include:

- A brief description of the bug.
- The expected behavior.
- The steps to reproduce.
- At least one resource.

Make sure to label it as a bug. Move the card to the `To Do` list.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

Think back to a chore you had in a recent lab or project and model that example. Move the chore to the `Done` column.

- Assign yourself to it.
- Add a due date.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

### Wireframes

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository.

1. Create a wireframe for the main page that shows an index view (on mobile).
1. Create a wireframe for a wide desktop view for either the index view.

1. Create a wireframe for the view that has a new form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view (on mobile).

## Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.

## Reflection

Write down three things that went well for you doing this lab.
 
 - wire framing is good, it'd be more efficent if i could use photo shop and create the elements i would use.
 - Storyboarding is a good way to break out what you want a program to do in steps.
 - I got my 3 sections and divs so i feel the layout with work IF i could control it with CSS

Write down one thing you'd improve on for next time.

> It's just gonna take some time and find support for the CSS; im basically just guess and copying work that I find on skillshare currently. It's VERY frustrating and maybe we could spend some time on it in class? But i doubt it!
