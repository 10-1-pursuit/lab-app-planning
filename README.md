### Wireframes

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository.

1. Create a wireframe for the main page that shows an index view (on mobile).

> ![Index on mobile view]()

1. Create a wireframe for a wide desktop view for either the index view.

> ![Index on desktop view]()

1. Create a wireframe for the view that has a new form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view (on mobile).

> ![New view]()

## Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.
